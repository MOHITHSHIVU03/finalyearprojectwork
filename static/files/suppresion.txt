presents to us with right leg swelling , pain and tenderness times
2-3 days. The patient was last discharged from A De Medical Center for congestive heart failure exacerbation and chronic
abdominal distention on June , 2000. She was in her usual state
of poor health until three days prior to admission when she noted
an increase in lower extremity edema bilaterally. Two days prior
to admission she noted fever , increased abdominal distention and
abdominal pain. She noted rash in the right lower extremity the
day prior to presentation which had rapidly progressed over one
day , extending from heel to knee. She had not been walking for
four days due to swelling in bilateral legs. She denies chest pain ,
dyspnea , constipation , diarrhea , orthopnea , PND , nocturia , melena.
She does not keep track of her own weight. Her last bowel movement
was one day prior to admission which was normal brown , slightly
loose.

ALLERGIES: Include Aldomet , nifedipine , darvocet which makes her
drowsy , Percocet which makes her vomit.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her sister in Morp Dr The son is
involved in her care. She does not have a history
of smoking or drinking. Her husband died a year ago of
complications from cardiac bypass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 102.1 , blood
pressure 148/68 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 ,
sating 92% on two liters. General examination: This is an obese
woman lying at a 30 degree angle on the bed , pleasant and not in
acute distress. Head and neck examination was benign. Lungs have
rales up one-third of the lungs bilaterally , no wheezes or rhonchi.
Heart regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 with S3 and II/VI systolic
murmur , best heard over the base. Jugular venous pulsation at 11
cm. Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , mildly distended ,
no mass and normal bowel sounds. Extremities showed diffuse
erythema from right heel extending to 5 cm below the knee , mild
tenderness , edema greater in the right leg than the left leg. 3+
pitting edema bilaterally. She also has a 5 cm x 5 cm skin graft
over the right heel with some skin breakdown around the graft site ,
slightly weepy , no pus. Neurologic examination: The patient is
alert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves are intact. The
patient does not have any sensation in bilateral legs. Normal
strength.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for hematocrit of 30.7 , white blood
count 10 , 340 , with a differential of 76 polys , 14
bands , 5 lymphocytes. Chem-7 was significant for creatinine of
1.8. Her liver function tests were within normal range. Her CK
first set was 120 with an MB of 2.6 and troponin of 1.39 , coags
normal D-dimer of greater than 1 , 010. Her urinalysis was negative.
Electrocardiogram showed 1 mm ST depression in the lateral leads ,
unchanged from baseline. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral
interstitial prominence , could be consistent with pulmonary edema ,
no focal opacities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
PROBLEM #1 , CELLULITIS: On admission , the patient was started on
cefazolin and Flagyl for broad coverage of cellulitis given she has
a history of diabetes mellitus. In addition , levofloxacin was
also started on hospital day #2 to cover gram negative organisms.
Blood cultures on admission are negative. Because of the skin
graft on the patient's right heel , plastic surgery was consulted to
assess the integrity of the skin graft. They concluded that the
skin graft is intact and the source of the cellulitis was not in
the heel. On hospital day #3 , Flagyl was discontinued because the
patient could not tolerate oral sores and the GI upset. Therefore ,
we elected to change the antibiotic regimen to Clindamycin and
levofloxacin. cefazolin and Flagyl were discontinued. On hospital
day #6 the patient developed diarrhea. Given her history of C.
difficile in the past and the lack of improvement in her
cellulitis , Infectious Disease were consulted. We started
cefotaxime and Vancomycin on hospital day #7. The patient
continued to have low grade temperature spikes with daily blood
cultures which have all been negative. Wound culture of the bullae
on the right lower extremity was also taken which has also been
negative. Vancomycin was discontinued due to low suspicions of
resistant organisms. The patient also had LENIs which were
negative for DVT as well as a right foot film which showed no signs
of osteomyelitis. Unfortunately , the cellulitis does not look
significantly improved. We postulate that this is due to a
combination of noncompliance with strict elevation , peripheral
edema from congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease
and diabetes. The patient continued to spike low grade
temperatures. We carried out pan culture which have all been
negative so far including urine , blood. At the time of this
dictation the patient has been on cefotaxime for seven days.
Infectious Disease recommends an MRI to rule out osteo and deeper
infection since the cellulitis is very slowly improving.
PROBLEM #2 , CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE AND CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:
On admission we started to diurese the patient as she was volume
overloaded by examination. In addition , we started her on her
outpatient blood pressure medications to control her hypertension.
However , on hospital day #2 , the patient's blood pressure dipped
into the high 90s to 100 with a rise in creatinine. We withheld
all blood pressure medication as well as diuresis. Her creatinine
continued to climb from 2.2 to 3.3. The urinalysis showed numerous
red blood cells and no eosinophils. Of note , her urine culture
grew out lactobacillus which was not treated. Renal was consulted ,
and it was thought that the patient's acute renal failure was due
to prerenal causes from a drop in blood pressure as well as mild
ATN. The patient's creatinine responded to gentle fluid boluses
and resolved on its own by hospital day #7. During the period of
acute renal failure , the patient also had marked hyponatremia which
also resolved as the renal function improved. The patient's
creatinine improved to 1.1 on hospital day #10. At this time , she
underwent a CT with contrast to delineate a possible liver mass.
Her subsequent creatinine climbed to 1.8. We had also started her
on her outpatient dose of enalapril and Lasix. We elected to
discontinue the enalapril and Lasix due to her increased
creatinine. We will observe and add back an ace inhibitor as
tolerated.
PROBLEM #3 , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST NON Q-WAVE
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient was admitted on a rule out
protocol. On her third set of enzymes she showed a CK of 142 , CK MB
of 2.2 but a troponin of 6.64. The patient was asymptomatic with
no chest pains and no electrocardiogram changes. Cardiology was
consulted and it was felt that the patient had a small non Q-wave
myocardial infarction with a troponin leak. A repeat echo on this
admission showed preserved EF at 55% with no observable wall motion
abnormalities. As the patient has refused catheterization in the
past , it was decided that she be managed medically. She was
started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d. as well as aspirin. The
patient has remained symptom free.
PROBLEM #4 , HYPERTENSION: The patient was initially slightly
hypotensive at a systolic blood pressure of 90s to 100 on hospital
day #1. Her enalapril and outpatient dose of Atenolol were held.
She was started back on Metoprolol after the non Q-wave myocardial
infarction. Currently , her blood pressure is maintained between
130-150 systolic. We attempted to add back enalapril at this time
to preserve her kidney function given her diabetes. However , her
creatinine increased mildly , thus we have elected to hold enalapril
again.
PROBLEM #5 , GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient has a history of chronic
constipation on home regimen of Dulcolax , senna , Colace and
lactulose. A KUB was obtained on admission which showed air in the
colon but no obstruction. It was thought that her chronic
distention is from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility.
The patient developed diarrhea during her hospital course for which
her laxatives were held. Her stool has been C. difficile negative.
She has tolerated very little food due to abdominal distention.
She has continued to advance her diet currently to some small
snacks during the day. Her laxatives were re-instituted. Because
the patient continued to spike a low grade temperature and she had
some abnormal liver function tests , we pursued a renal ultrasound
to rule out her renal abscess which was negative , as well as a
right upper quadrant ultrasound. The right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a possible liver mass for which we ordered a
followup CT of the abdomen. The CT of the abdomen showed normal
variant of the shape of the liver , caused by a bowel loop that was
anterior to the liver. This is unchanged compared to a study that
she had in 1996.
PROBLEM #6 , ANEMIA: On admission the patient was slightly anemic
with a hematocrit of 30. During her past hospitalizations , the
patient always had a hematocrit around 30. On this admission her
stools were trace guaiac positive. She received two units of packed
red blood cell transfusion with an appropriate response to a
hematocrit of 36. GI was consulted. However , since the patient was
stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it was decided
that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in
terms of colonoscopy.
PROBLEM #7 , VASCULAR: The patient has a history of peripheral
vascular disease on admission. The Vascular Surgery service was
consulted to help manage refractory cellulitis. ABIs were obtained
of the right leg which showed 0.5 to 0.6 on the right lower
extremity and normal on the left lower extremity which has been
previously bypassed. Pulse volume recording revealed mildly
decreased signal in both the right and left leg. The conclusion
was that the patient had right femoral popliteal disease with
normal resting pressures on the left. However , as the patient is
not very mobile , she does not complain of any claudication
symptoms. It was decided that no surgery is indicated for her at
this time. We used heparin subcutaneous injections as her DVT
prophylaxis during her hospitalization.
PROBLEM #8 , CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has congestive
heart failure from diastolic dysfunction. On examination , she has
1+ edema throughout her body including her upper limbs in the chest
area. However , attempts at diuresis were aborted due to acute
renal failure. She continued to diurese on her own without any
pharmacologic interventions , as her creatinine improved. At this
time her Lasix is held because of a small bump in creatinine from
likely the contrast in CT as well as in the enalapril. Overall , she
is total body volume up , however , much improved from admission.
PROBLEM #9 , TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient's blood sugars
were poorly controlled during the hospitalization with finger
sticks in the high 100s to low 200s. This is partially due to the
patient's reluctance to take her full dose of NPH Insulin because
she is inconsistent with eating. She also has a sliding scale to
cover her. We will encourage her to continue with her full dose of
Insulin as she tolerates food better.
PROBLEM #10 , PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND LOW BACK PAIN: The
patient's Neurontin dose was reduced to 100 mg t.i.d. from her
outpatient dose of 300 mg t.i.d. due to renal insufficiency. She
also received Diazepam currently at 2.5 mg b.i.d. , reduced from her
outpatient dose of 5.5 mg b.i.d. because of renal insufficiency.
She also requires morphine sulfate on a p.r.n. basis. Her pain
control is satisfactory at the time of this dictation.
