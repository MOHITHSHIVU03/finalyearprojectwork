      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Midget is a 56-year-old male with a past medical history significant for inferior myocardial infarction in 1995 , which was treated with angioplasty at that time. Since then , he has been stable on medical management until approximately two months prior to this admission , when he began noting anterior chest pain with exertion. He underwent a stress test , which was found to be abnormal , and was referred for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed on 10/3/06 at Au Hospital . This study revealed a 70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending coronary artery , a 90% mid segment stenosis of his first diagonal coronary artery , a 50% mid segment stenosis of his circumflex coronary artery , a 90% ostial stenosis of his first obtuse marginal , a 100% proximal stenosis of his right coronary artery as well as a 30% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Collateral flow was noted from the left anterior descending to the posterior descending coronary artery. Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , he was referred for elective revascularization.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , lower back pain , nephrolithiasis as well as a 3.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm at the bifurcation of the aorta.\n",
      "\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o. daily , Vicodin 5 mg p.o. as needed for low back pain as well as vitamins C , D , A , and E. The patient was seen in the Lumne Medical Center on 1/25/06 and underwent physical examination.\n",

Coronary artery disease.\\n3. Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia.\\n5. Type II diabetes mellitus. 6. Gastroesophageal reflux\\ndisease.\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS: The patient had a head MRI ,\\nan echocardiogram , and head\\nCT scan.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This [65.5] years old male was in his usual\\nstate of health until the morning of\\nadmission when he woke up with speech difficulty noticed by his\\nwife. The patient was noted to make paraphasic errors. In\\naddition , there was a question of a right facial droop. The\\npatient presented to the emergency room. There were no other\\nneurologic symptoms.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission revealed\\npulse 78 , temperature 98.8 , and blood\\npressure 160/78. The patient was in no apparent distress. The\\nhead and neck examination was unremarkable. The neck was supple.\\nThe thyroid gland was not enlarged. The lungs were clear. There\\nwas a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs. The\\nabdomen was soft and non-tender. There was no peripheral edema.\\nThe patient was alert and oriented to his name and to place. The\\npatient had difficulty giving the exact date and month. The\\npatient was unable to register three objects properly. The\\npatient's speech was non-fluent with impaired naming. Repetition\\nwas also affected. There was right left confusion , severe\\nacalculia , as well as poor reading and writing. The patient had no\\nneglect or apraxia. The patient was able to copy a complicated\\nfigure without problems. The cranial nerves were intact , except\\nfor a mild right upper motor neuron facial palsy. There was no\\npronator drift and the strength was 5/5 in all four extremities.\\nSensation was intact to primal modalities. The reflexes were 2+\\nand symmetric with downgoing toes. The patient had normal gait.\\nLABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed serum\\nelectrolytes to be normal , except for a potassium\\nof 5.3. The glucose was 168. The white count was 7.8 , hematocrit\\n38.8 , and platelets 223. A PT and PTT were normal. A head CT scan\\nshowed a subtle hyperdensity in the left frontal region. This was\\nlater confirmed by MRI. The patient had carotid ultrasounds , which\\nshowed a 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The\\nright internal carotid was stenosed to 25%.\\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital with a\\ndiagnosis of probable embolic stroke. An MRI\\nshowed a wedge shaped frontal lobe infarct. Clinically , the\\npatient's speech improved and he regained fluency within the next\\n24 hours. The patient's naming was relatively preserved.\\nComprehension was intact for simple commands. However , the patient\\ncontinued to have right left indiscrimination , acalculia , as well\\nas a defect in reading and writing. The patient was initially\\nunable to add two plus two , but by the end of the hospitalization ,\\nhe was able to add nine plus six. However , the patient's\\ncalculation never returned to his baseline function. The patient\\nhad an echocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 60% ,\\nwith no significant valvular disease. There was no thrombus noted\\nin the left atrium. The patient was started on intravenous Heparin\\non admission , and was then converted to oral Coumadin. The patient\\nruled out for myocardial infarction on admission. The patient was\\nkept on a cardiac monitor with no cardiac events noted. The\\npatient was seen by the Neurobehavioral Service because of his\\naphasia.\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient\\nwas on Allopurinol , Atenolol ,\\nColchicine , Prilosec , Lipitor , and Coumadin.
